# Data-Sicence-Project-Flight-Data-Analysis-

The codes analyze US passenger flight data from 2000 to 2015. See the report for more details.

The main codes consist of 

main1.m: to generate figures 1-4 (in the report)
main2.m: to generate figures 5 (in the report)
main3.m: to generate figures 6-13 (in the report)

These files download and import csv files from http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

You may also want to skip the downloading and importing parts, and load the .mat data (which has been saved before). Just comment on those parts, and uncomment ‘load Output*.mat’, where * corresponds to main*.m
